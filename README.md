# solidDNPliquids

This is a supplementary repository for the manuscripts "Dynamic view of the soild-state DNP effect" (https://doi.org/10.5194/mr-2023-1) and "The solid-state DNP effect in liquids" (https://doi.org/10.5194/mr-2023-2). The provided files generate the figures in the manuscripts. As they were not made with the intention of public sharing, the files are messy and poorly commented. If needed, please contact Deniz Sezer for explanations.

The included files are as follows:
1. funs.py: Contains helper functions
2. plots.py: Uses the above functions to generate plots
3. paper1.py: Calls the plotting functions to make the figures of Paper I (mr-2023-1)
4. paper2.py: Calls the plotting functions to make the figures of Paper II (mr-2023-2)

The generated pdf plots are in the directory 'pdfs'.

The experimental data analyzed in Paper II is in the directory 'data', which contains the following two files:
1. figureS8-EPR.dat : EPR spectrum of BDPA shown in Fig. S8 of Kuzhelev, JACS, 144, 1164 (2022)
2. figureS8-DNP.dat : DNP spectrum of BDPA shown in Fig. S8 of Kuzhelev, JACS, 144, 1164 (2022)
